## Definition of Computer Network

A computer network is a collection of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other to share resources, exchange data, and enable collaboration. These connections can be established using wired or wireless technologies, allowing users to access information and services efficiently.

## Types of Computer Networks

There are many types of computer networks, each designed for specific purposes and environments. Below is a table highlighting some of the most common network types, along with brief and expanded explanations.

| Network Type | Short Explanation | Expanded Explanation |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| LAN (Local Area Network) | Connects computers within a limited area like a home, school, or office. | [Learn more about LANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/local-area-network-lan/) - LANs are fast, secure, and ideal for small geographic areas. |
| WAN (Wide Area Network) | Covers a large geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs. | [Learn more about WANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wide-area-network-wan/) - WANs use public or private transmission systems to link distant locations. |
| MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) | Spans a city or large campus. | [Learn more about MANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/metropolitan-area-network-man/) - MANs are larger than LANs but smaller than WANs, often used by organizations with multiple buildings. |
| PAN (Personal Area Network) | Connects devices within a person's workspace, like Bluetooth. | [Learn more about PANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/personal-area-network-pan/) - PANs are used for short-range communication between personal devices. |
| WLAN (Wireless LAN) | LAN using wireless technology. | [Learn more about WLANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wireless-local-area-network-wlan/) - WLANs provide mobility and flexibility within a local area. |
| CAN (Campus Area Network) | Connects networks within a campus, like a university. | [Learn more about CANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/campus-area-network-can/) - CANs are designed for large institutions with multiple buildings. |
| SAN (Storage Area Network) | Dedicated to data storage devices. | [Learn more about SANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-area-network-san/) - SANs provide high-speed connections for data storage and retrieval. |
| VPN (Virtual Private Network) | Securely connects remote users to a private network over the internet. | [Learn more about VPNs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-private-network-vpn/) - VPNs use encryption to protect data and ensure privacy. |
| GAN (Global Area Network) | Connects networks across the globe. | [Learn more about GANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-area-network-gan/) - GANs are used for worldwide communication and data sharing. |

## Network Devices

Network devices are essential components that enable communication, data transfer, and security within computer networks. Below is a comprehensive table describing key network devices, their visual representation, definitions, roles, how they work, and links to further reading.

| Device | Visual View | Definition | Role | How It Works | Expanded Explain |
|--------|-------------|------------|------|--------------|------------------|
| Repeater | ![Repeater](static/repeater.png) | A device that regenerates and amplifies signals to extend the range of a network. | Extends network coverage by boosting weak signals. | Receives weak signals and retransmits them at full strength. | [Repeater - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/repeater-in-computer-network/) |
| Bridge | ![Bridge](static/bridge.png) | Connects and filters traffic between two network segments. | Divides networks to reduce traffic and improve performance. | Examines incoming data and forwards it to the correct segment. | [Bridge - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bridge-in-computer-network/) |
| Host (Computer) | ![Host](static/computer-3.png) | Any device (PC, server, etc.) that sends or receives data on a network. | Acts as a source or destination for network communication. | Uses network protocols to communicate with other devices. | [Host - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/host-in-computer-network/) |
| Hub | ![Hub](static/hub.png) | A basic device that connects multiple computers in a network. | Central connection point for devices in a LAN. | Broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices. | [Hub - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hub-in-computer-network/) |
| Router | ![Router](static/router.png) | Directs data packets between networks and manages traffic. | Connects different networks and routes data efficiently. | Uses routing tables to determine the best path for data. | [Router - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/router-in-computer-network/) |
| Switch | ![Switch](static/workgroup-switch.png) | Connects devices in a network and forwards data only to the intended recipient. | Improves network efficiency and security. | Learns device addresses and sends data to the correct port. | [Switch - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/switch-in-computer-network/) |
| Access Point | ![Access Point](static/wireless-access-point.png) | Provides wireless connectivity to devices in a network. | Enables Wi-Fi access for mobile and wireless devices. | Transmits and receives wireless signals to/from devices. | [Access Point - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-point-in-computer-network/) |
| Firewall | ![Firewall](static/firewall.png) | Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. | Protects networks from unauthorized access and threats. | Uses rules to allow or block traffic based on security policies. | [Firewall - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/firewall-in-computer-network/) |
