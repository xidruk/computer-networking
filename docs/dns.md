# DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS (Domain Name System) is the backbone of the Internet’s naming system. It translates easy-to-remember domain names (like www.example.com) into numerical IP addresses that computers use to identify each other. Without DNS, browsing the web would require memorizing long strings of numbers for every site you visit. DNS makes the Internet user-friendly, scalable, and reliable by providing a distributed, automated way to resolve names to addresses.
