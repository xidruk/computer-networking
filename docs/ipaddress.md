# IP Address

## What is an IP Address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over the network.

## How Does an IP Address Work?
IP addresses are used to identify devices and route data between them. When a device sends data, the IP address helps ensure it reaches the correct destination. Routers and switches use IP addresses to forward packets across networks.

## Types of IP Addresses
- **IPv4:** The most widely used type, consisting of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **IPv6:** A newer type designed to replace IPv4, using eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Public IP Address:** Used to identify devices on the global internet.
- **Private IP Address:** Used within local networks and not routable on the internet.
- **Static IP Address:** Manually assigned and does not change.
- **Dynamic IP Address:** Automatically assigned and may change over time.

## How Are IP Addresses Allocated?
IP addresses can be allocated in several ways:
- **Manual Allocation:** Network administrators assign static IP addresses to devices.
- **Automatic Allocation:** Devices receive dynamic IP addresses from a server using protocols like DHCP.

### Types of IP Address Allocation
1. **Static Allocation:** The address is set manually and remains fixed.
2. **Dynamic Allocation:** The address is assigned automatically and may change, typically managed by a DHCP server.
