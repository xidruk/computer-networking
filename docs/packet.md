## What is a Packet?

A **packet** is a small unit of data that travels across a network.  
When you send something online whether it’s a message, an email, a video, or a file it doesn’t move as one big chunk. Instead, the information is divided into smaller, manageable pieces. These pieces are called packets.

Imagine you want to send a large book through the mail. You wouldn’t put the entire book into a single oversized package. Instead, you would split it into several smaller parcels. Each parcel would have:
- The address of the sender
- The address of the recipient
- A note about which part of the book it contains

When the parcels arrive, they can be put back together in the right order to recreate the complete book.  
This is exactly how packets work in computer networks: each one carries a piece of the data, along with instructions about where it came from, where it should go, and how it fits with the other packets.

This method makes communication on the internet more efficient. Even if some packets take different paths through the network, they eventually come together at the destination to form the original message or file.
