## What is a Packet?

In computer networking, a **packet** is like a small envelope that carries data across a network.  
When you send information over the internet—like an email, a photo, or a message—the data is broken down into smaller chunks called packets. These packets travel independently and are reassembled at the destination to form the original data.

Think of it like sending a book through the mail:  
- Instead of sending the whole book at once, you send each page in separate envelopes.  
- Each envelope has a label with the sender, receiver, and the page number so the book can be put back together correctly.

**Key Points:**
- Packets are small units of data.
- Each packet travels independently through the network.
- They contain control information to help them reach the correct destination and order.
