# Segment

This document explains the concept of a segment in computer networking.

## What is a Segment?
A segment is a unit of data transmission used at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI Model. Segments are created by breaking down large messages into smaller, manageable pieces for efficient transport.

## Key Points
- Used in Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI Model
- Enables reliable data transfer and flow control
- Segments are reassembled at the destination

## Examples
- TCP segments
- Data sent using transport protocols
